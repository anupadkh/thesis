abstract = {Knowledge of protein structural class plays an important role in characterizing the overall folding type of a given protein. At present, it is still a challenge to extract sequence information solely using protein sequence for protein structural class prediction with low similarity sequence in the current computational biology. In this study, a novel sequence representation method is proposed based on position specific scoring matrix for protein structural class prediction. By defined evolutionary difference formula, varying length proteins are expressed as uniform dimensional vectors, which can represent evolutionary difference information between the adjacent residues of a given protein. To perform and evaluate the proposed method, support vector machine and jackknife tests are employed on three widely used datasets, 25PDB, 1189 and 640 datasets with sequence similarity lower than 25{\%}, 40{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively. Comparison of our results with the previous methods shows that our method may provide a promising method to predict protein structural class especially for low-similarity sequences. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Xu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. Background: DNA-binding proteins play a pivotal role in various intra- and extra-cellular activities ranging from DNA replication to gene expression control. Identification of DNA-binding proteins is one of the major challenges in the field of genome annotation. There have been several computational methods proposed in the literature to deal with the DNA-binding protein identification. However, most of them can't provide an invaluable knowledge base for our understanding of DNA-protein interactions. Results: We firstly presented a new protein sequence encoding method called PSSM Distance Transformation, and then constructed a DNA-binding protein identification method (SVM-PSSM-DT) by combining PSSM Distance Transformation with support vector machine (SVM). First, the PSSM profiles are generated by using the PSI-BLAST program to search the non-redundant (NR) database. Next, the PSSM profiles are transformed into uniform numeric representations appropriately by distance transformation scheme. Lastly, the resulting uniform numeric representations are inputted into a SVM classifier for prediction. Thus whether a sequence can bind to DNA or not can be determined. In benchmark test on 525 DNA-binding and 550 non DNA-binding proteins using jackknife validation, the present model achieved an ACC of 79.96{\%}, MCC of 0.622 and AUC of 86.50{\%}. This performance is considerably better than most of the existing state-of-the-art predictive methods. When tested on a recently constructed independent dataset PDB186, SVM-PSSM-DT also achieved the best performance with ACC of 80.00{\%}, MCC of 0.647 and AUC of 87.40{\%}, and outperformed some existing state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: The experiment results demonstrate that PSSM Distance Transformation is an available protein sequence encoding method and SVM-PSSM-DT is a useful tool for identifying the DNA-binding proteins. A user-friendly web-server of SVM-PSSM-DT was constructed, which is freely accessible to the public at the web-site on http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/PSSM-DT/.},

abstract = {While genome sequencing projects have generated tremendous amounts of protein sequence data for a vast number of genomes, substantial portions of most genomes are still unannotated. Despite the success of experimental methods for identifying protein functions, they are often lab intensive and time consuming. Thus, it is only practical to use in silico methods for the genome-wide functional annotations. In this paper, we propose new features extracted from protein sequence only and machine learning-based methods for computational function prediction. These features are derived from a position-specific scoring matrix, which has shown great potential in other bininformatics problems. We evaluate these features using four different classifiers and yeast protein data. Our experimental results show that features derived from the position-specific scoring matrix are appropriate for automatic function annotation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Computational prediction of the interaction between drugs and targets is a standing challenge in the field of drug discovery. A number of rather accurate predictions were reported for various binary drug-target benchmark datasets. However, a notable drawback of a binary representation of interaction data is that missing endpoints for non-interacting drug-target pairs are not differentiated from inactive cases, and that predicted levels of activity depend on pre-defined binarization thresholds. In this paper, we present a method called SimBoost that predicts continuous (non-binary) values of binding affinities of compounds and proteins and thus incorporates the whole interaction spectrum from true negative to true positive interactions. Additionally, we propose a version of the method called SimBoostQuant which computes a prediction interval in order to assess the confidence of the predicted affinity, thus defining the Applicability Domain metrics explicitly. We evaluate SimBoost and SimBoostQuant on two established drug-target interaction benchmark datasets and one new dataset that we propose to use as a benchmark for read-across cheminformatics applications. We demonstrate that our methods outperform the previously reported models across the studied datasets.},

In order to remove redundant information, a novel feature selection technique was employed to single out optimized features.

abstract = {Motivation: Classification by supervised machine learning greatly facilitates the annotation of protein characteristics from their primary sequence. However, the feature generation step in this process requires detailed knowledge of attributes used to classify the proteins. Lack of this knowledge risks the selection of irrelevant features, resulting in a faulty model. In this study, we introduce a supervised protein classification method with a novel means of automating the work-intensive feature generation step via a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-dependent model, using a modified combination of n-grams and skip-grams (m-NGSG). Results: A meta-comparison of cross-validation accuracy with twelve training datasets from nine different published studies demonstrates a consistent increase in accuracy of m-NGSG when compared to contemporary classification and feature generation models. We expect this model to accelerate the classification of proteins from primary sequence data and increase the accessibility of protein characteristic prediction to a broader range of scientists.

abstract = {We propose a Deep Texture Encoding Network (Deep-TEN) with a novel Encoding Layer integrated on top of convolutional layers, which ports the entire dictionary learning and encoding pipeline into a single model. Current methods build from distinct components, using standard encoders with separate off-the-shelf features such as SIFT descriptors or pre-trained CNN features for material recognition. Our new approach provides an end-to-end learning framework, where the inherent visual vocabularies are learned directly from the loss function. The features, dictionaries and the encoding representation for the classifier are all learned simultaneously. The representation is orderless and therefore is particularly useful for material and texture recognition. The Encoding Layer generalizes robust residual encoders such as VLAD and Fisher Vectors, and has the property of discarding domain specific information which makes the learned convolutional features easier to transfer. Additionally, joint training using multiple datasets of varied sizes and class labels is supported resulting in increased recognition performance. The experimental results show superior performance as compared to state-of-the-art methods using gold-standard databases such as MINC-2500, Flickr Material Database, KTH-TIPS-2b, and two recent databases 4D-Light-Field-Material and GTOS.

Next, strategies to select an appropriate residual variance–covariance structure are summarized. Scaling techniques for the time factor are then displayed. An overview is provided for the definition of a classification factor, with a number of basic coding schemes being introduced. The design matrices for the time factor and for its interaction with another classification factor are also delineated. This is followed by the computational procedures of least squares means, the local contrasts, and local tests, respectively. Lastly, an empirical illustration is provided for displaying how to apply the linear regression model specifying a residual variance–covariance pattern.},

However, the dearth of reliable binding structure and affinity data has required the use of constructed datasets for the training and evaluation of CNN molecular recognition models. Here we outline sources of dataset bias and have constructed and performed tests to investigate whether CNN models are properly learning the underlying physics of molecular recognition or are instead learning biases inherent in the datasets themselves. We find that superior enrichment efficiency in CNN models can be attributed to the analogue and decoy bias hidden in the DUD-E datasets used to train and test the model rather than successful generalization of the pattern of protein-ligand interactions. Comparing additional deep learning models trained by PDBbind datasets, we found that their enrichment performances using the DUD-E dataset are not superior to the performance of the docking program AutoDock Vina. ​ [ Abstract Image]},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions play essential roles in many biological processes. Acquiring knowledge of the residue-residue contact information of two interacting proteins is not only helpful in annotating functions for proteins, but also critical for structure-based drug design. The prediction of the protein residue-residue contact matrix of the interfacial regions is challenging. In this work, we introduced deep learning techniques (specifically, stacked autoencoders) to build deep neural network models to tackled the residue-residue contact prediction problem. In tandem with interaction profile Hidden Markov Models, which was used first to extract Fisher score features from protein sequences, stacked autoencoders were deployed to extract and learn hidden abstract features. The deep learning model showed significant improvement over the traditional machine learning model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), with the overall accuracy increased by 15{\%} from 65.40{\%} to 80.82{\%}. We showed that the stacked autoencoders could extract novel features, which can be utilized by deep neural networks and other classifiers to enhance learning, out of the Fisher score features. It is further shown that deep neural networks have significant advantages over SVM in making use of the newly extracted features.},

abstract = {We used a nonredundant set of 621 protein–protein interfaces of known high-resolu-tion structure to derive residue composition and residue–residue contact preferences. The residue composition at the interfaces, in entire proteins and in whole genomes correlates well, indicating the statistical strength of the data set. Differences be-tween amino acid distributions were observed for interfaces with buried surface area of less than 1,000 {\AA} 2 versus interfaces with area of more than 5,000 {\AA} 2 . Hydrophobic residues were abundant in large interfaces while polar residues were more abundant in small interfaces. The largest residue– residue preferences at the interface were recorded for interactions between pairs of large hydrophobic residues, such as Trp and Leu, and the smallest preferences for pairs of small residues, such as Gly and Ala. On average, contacts between pairs of hydrophobic and polar residues were unfavorable, and the charged residues tended to pair subject to charge complementarity, in agreement with previ-ous reports. A bootstrap procedure, lacking from previous studies, was used for error estimation. It showed that the statistical errors in the set of pairing preferences are generally small; the average standard error is Ϸ0.2, i.e., about 8{\%} of the average value of the pairwise index (2.9). However, for a few pairs (e.g., Ser–Ser and Glu–Asp) the standard error is larger in magnitude than the pairing index, which makes it impossible to tell whether contact forma-tion is favorable or unfavorable. The results are interpreted using physicochemical factors and their implications for the energetics of complex forma-tion and for protein docking are discussed. Proteins 2001;43:89 –102.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Aumentado-Armstrong et al.; licensee BioMed Central. Interaction sites on protein surfaces mediate virtually all biological activities, and their identification holds promise for disease treatment and drug design. Novel algorithmic approaches for the prediction of these sites have been produced at a rapid rate, and the field has seen significant advancement over the past decade. However, the most current methods have not yet been reviewed in a systematic and comprehensive fashion. Herein, we describe the intricacies of the biological theory, datasets, and features required for modern protein-protein interaction site (PPIS) prediction, and present an integrative analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms and their performance. First, the major sources of data used by predictors are reviewed, including training sets, evaluation sets, and methods for their procurement. Then, the features employed and their importance in the biological characterization of PPISs are explored. This is followed by a discussion of the methodologies adopted in contemporary prediction programs, as well as their relative performance on the datasets most recently used for evaluation. In addition, the potential utility that PPIS identification holds for rational drug design, hotspot prediction, and computational molecular docking is described. Finally, an analysis of the most promising areas for future development of the field is presented.},

abstract = {Motivation: The ability to generate massive amounts of sequencing data continues to overwhelm the processing capacity of existing algorithms and compute infrastructures. In this work, we explore the use of hardware/software co-design and hardware acceleration to significantly reduce the execution time of short sequence alignment, a crucial step in analyzing sequenced genomes. We introduce SLIDER, a highly parallel and accurate pre-alignment filter that remarkably reduces the need for com- putationally-costly dynamic programming algorithms. The first key idea of our proposed pre-alignment filter is to provide high filtering accuracy by correctly detecting all common subsequences shared be- tween two given sequences. The second key idea is to design a hardware accelerator design that adopts modern FPGA (field-programmable gate array) architectures to further boost the performance of our algorithm. Results: SLIDER significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment filtering by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art pre-alignment filters, GateKeeper and SHD. Our FPGA accelerator is up to three orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent CPU implementation of SLIDER. Using a single FPGA chip, we benchmark the benefits of integrating SLIDER with five state- of-the-art sequence aligners, designed for different computing platforms. The addition of SLIDER as a pre-alignment step reduces the execution time of five state-of-the-art sequence aligners by up to 18.8x. SLIDER can be adopted for any bioinformatics pipeline that performs sequence alignment for verifica- tion. Unlike most existing methods that aim to accelerate sequence alignment, SLIDER does not sac- rifice any of the aligner capabilities, as it does not modify or replace the alignment step.

Selecting a correct binding pose and predicting the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex enables effective virtual screening. Machine learning techniques can make use of the increasing amounts of structural data that are becoming publicly available. Convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions in particular have shown promise in pose selection and affinity prediction for protein-ligand complexes. Neural networks are known for being difficult to interpret. Understanding the decisions of a particular network can help tune parameters and training data to maximize performance. Visualization of neural networks helps decompose complex scoring functions into pictures that are more easily parsed by humans. Here we present three methods for visualizing how individual protein-ligand complexes are interpreted by 3D convolutional neural networks. We also present a visualization of the convolutional filters and their weights. We describe how the intuition provided by these visualizations aids in network design.},

We consider the prediction of interfaces between proteins, a challenging problem with important applications in drug discovery and design, and examine the performance of existing and newly proposed spatial graph convolution operators for this task. By performing convolution over a local neighborhood of a node of interest, we are able to stack multiple layers of convolution and learn effective latent representations that integrate information across the graph that represent the three dimensional structure of a protein of interest. An architecture that combines the learned features across pairs of proteins is then used to classify pairs of amino acid residues as part of an interface or not. In our experiments, several graph convolution operators yielded accuracy that is better than the state-of-the-art SVM method in this task.},

In Protein-Protein interaction (PPI), residue-residue interaction (R2R-I) prediction refers to the identification of pairs of interacting residues, usually under close contact, residing on separate interacting proteins.

Whereas high-throughput omics approaches are available, it is evident that any single omics approach might not be adequate to capture the complexity of phenotypes. Therefore, integrated multi-omics approaches have been used to unravel genotype–phenotype relationships such as global regulatory mechanisms and complex metabolic networks in different eukaryotic organisms. Some of the progress and challenges associated with integrated omics studies have been reviewed previously in comprehensive studies. In this work, we highlight and review the progress, challenges and advantages associated with emerging approaches, integrating gene expression and protein-protein interaction networks to unravel network-based functional features. This includes identifying disease related genes, gene prioritization, clustering protein interactions, developing the modules, extract active subnetworks and static protein complexes or dynamic/temporal protein complexes.

abstract = {Protein partitioning in aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) represents a convenient, inexpensive, and easy to scale-up protein separation technique. Since partition behavior of a protein dramatically depends on an ATPS composition, it would be highly beneficial to have reliable means for (even qualitative) prediction of partitioning of a target protein under different conditions. Our aim was to understand which structural features of proteins contribute to partitioning of a query protein in a given ATPS. We undertook a systematic empirical analysis of relations between 57 numerical structural descriptors derived from the corresponding amino acid sequences and crystal structures of 10 well-characterized proteins and the partition behavior of these proteins in 29 different ATPSs. This analysis revealed that just a few structural characteristics of proteins can accurately determine behavior of these proteins in a given ATPS. However, partition behavior of proteins in different ATPSs relies on different structural features. In other words, we could not find a unique set of protein structural features derived from their crystal structures that could be used for the description of the protein partition behavior of all proteins in all ATPSs analyzed in this study. We likely need to gain better insight into relationships between protein-solvent interactions and protein structure peculiarities, in particular given limitations of the used here crystal structures, to be able to construct a model that accurately predicts protein partition behavior across all ATPSs.},

Unlike the traditional methods like empirical scoring algorithms and molecular dynamic which are time consuming, we developed a fast and reliable machine learning method for the prediction of protein-protein binding affinity. Based on diverse protein-protein interface features calculated using commonly used available tools, 432 features were obtained to represent hydrogen bond, Van der Waals force, hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic force, interface shape and configuration and allosteric effect. Considering the limited number of the available structures and affinity-known protein complexes, in order to avoid overfitting and remove noises in the feature set, feature importance evaluation was implemented and 154 optimal features were selected, then the prediction model based on random forest (RF) was constructed. We demonstrate that the RF model yields promising results and the predictive power of our method is better than other existing methods. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, our model gives a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.708 on the whole benchmark dataset of 133 complexes and a high r of 0.806 on the validated set of 53 samples. When performing the same two independent datasets, our method outperforms other two methods and achieves a high r of 0.793 and 0.907 respectively. All results indicate that our method can be a useful implement in determining protein-protein binding affinity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Uranium toxicity depends on its chemical properties rather than on its radioactivity and involves its interaction with macromolecules. Here, a systematic survey of the structural features of the uranyl sites observed in protein crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank is reported. Beside the two uranyl oxygens, which occupy the axial positions, uranium tends to be coordinated by five other oxygen atoms, which occupy the equatorial vertices of a pentagonal bipyramid. Even if one or more of these equatorial positions are sometime empty, they can be occupied only by oxygen atoms that belong to the carboxylate groups of Glu and Asp side-chains, usually acting as monodentate ligands, to water molecules, or to acetate anions. Although several uranium sites appear undefined or unrefined, with a single uranium atom that lacks the two uranyl oxygen atoms, this problem seems to become less frequent in recent years. However, it is clear that the crystallographic refinements of the uranyl sites are not always well restrained and a better parametrization of these restraints seems to be necessary.},

abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Borrelia cause vector-borne infections like the most important hard tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, Lyme borreliosis (LB), and soft tick or louse transmitted relapsing fevers (RF), prevalent in temperate and tropical areas. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) includes several genospecies and causes LB in humans. In infected patients, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) expresses the BmpA, BmpB, BmpC and BmpD proteins. The role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of LB remains incompletely characterized, but they are, however, closely related to Treponema pallidum PnrA (Purine nucleoside receptor A), a substrate-binding lipoprotein of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family preferentially binding purine nucleosides. Based on 3D homology modeling, the Bmp proteins share the typical fold of the substrate-binding protein family and the ligand-binding properties of BmpA, BmpB and BmpD are highly similar, whereas those of BmpC differ markedly. Nevertheless, these residues are highly conserved within the genus Borrelia and the inferred phylogenetic tree also reveals that the RF Borrelia lack BmpB proteins but has an additional Bmp protein (BmpA2) missing in LB-causing Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Our results indicate that the Bmp proteins could bind nucleosides, although BmpC might have a different ligand-binding specificity and, therefore, a distinct function. Furthermore, the work provides a means for classifying the Bmp proteins and supports further elucidation of the roles of these proteins.},

This paper was devoted to develop a powerful method to predict protein structural classes for low-similarity sequences. On the basis of a very objective and strict benchmark dataset, we firstly extracted optimal tripeptide compositions (OTC) which was picked out by using feature selection technique to formulate protein samples. And an overall accuracy of 91.1{\%} was achieved in jackknife cross-validation. Subsequently, we investigated the accuracies of three popular features: position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), predicted secondary structure information (PSSI) and the average chemical shift (ACS) for comparison. Finally, to further improve the prediction performance, we examined all combinations of the four kinds of features and achieved the maximum accuracy of 96.7{\%} in jackknife cross-validation by combining OTC with ACS, demonstrating that the model is efficient and powerful. Our study will provide an important guide to extract valuable information from protein sequences.},

@article{Williamson2013,
abstract = {Chemical shift perturbation (CSP, chemical shift mapping or complexation-induced changes in chemical shift, CIS) follows changes in the chemical shifts of a protein when a ligand is added, and uses these to determine the location of the binding site, the affinity of the ligand, and/or possibly the structure of the complex. A key factor in determining the appearance of spectra during a titration is the exchange rate between free and bound, or more specifically the off-rate koff. When koff is greater than the chemical shift difference between free and bound, which typically equates to an affinity Kd weaker than about 3 pM, then exchange is fast on the chemical shift timescale. Under these circumstances, the observed shift is the population-weighted average of free and bound, which allows Kd to be determined from measurement of peak positions, provided the measurements are made appropriately. 1H shifts are influenced to a large extent by through-space interactions, whereas 13Ca and 13Q? shifts are influenced more by through-bond effects. 15N and 13C shifts are influenced both by through-bond and by through-space (hydrogen bonding) interactions. For determining the location of a bound ligand on the basis of shift change, the most appropriate method is therefore usually to measure 15N HSQC spectra, calculate the geometrical distance moved by the peak, weighting 15N shifts by a factor of about 0.14 compared to 1H shifts, and select those residues for which the weighted shift change is larger than the standard deviation of the shift for all residues. Other methods are discussed, in particular the measurement of 13CH3 signals. Slow to intermediate exchange rates lead to line broadening, and make Kd values very difficult to obtain. There is no good way to distinguish changes in chemical shift due to direct binding of the ligand from changes in chemical shift due to allosteric change. Ligand binding at multiple sites can often be characterised, by simultaneous fitting of many measured shift changes, or more simply by adding substo- ichiometric amounts of ligand. The chemical shift changes can be used as restraints for docking ligand onto protein. By use of quantitative calculations of ligand-induced chemical shift changes, it is becoming possible to determine not just the position but also the orientation of ligands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in diverse functions in a cell. To optimize functional roles of interactions, proteins interact with a spectrum of binding affinities. Interactions are conventionally classified into permanent and transient, where the former denotes tight binding between proteins that result in strong complexes, whereas the latter compose of relatively weak interactions that can dissociate after binding to regulate functional activity at specific time point. Knowing the type of interactions has significant implications for understanding the nature and function of PPIs. In this study, we constructed amino acid substitution models that capture mutation patterns at permanent and transient type of protein interfaces, which were found to be different with statistical significance. Using the substitution models, we developed a novel computational method that predicts permanent and transient protein binding interfaces (PBIs) in protein surfaces. Without knowledge of the interacting partner, the method uses a single query protein structure and a multiple sequence alignment of the sequence family. Using a large dataset of permanent and transient proteins, we show that our method, BindML+, performs very well in protein interface classification. A very high area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.957 was observed when predicted protein binding sites were classified. Remarkably, near prefect accuracy was achieved with an AUC of 0.991 when actual binding sites were classified. The developed method will be also useful for protein design of permanent and transient PBIs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99{\%} of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

abstract = {Involved in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative, inflammatory and respiratory disorders, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs. It is time-consuming and expensive to determine whether a drug and a GPCR are to interact with each other in a cellular network purely by means of experimental techniques. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the 3D (dimensional) structure of protein, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because the 3D structures for most GPCRs are still unknown. To overcome the situation, a sequence-based classifier, called "iGPCR-drug", was developed to predict the interactions between GPCRs and drugs in cellular networking. In the predictor, the drug compound is formulated by a 2D (dimensional) fingerprint via a 256D vector, GPCR by the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) generated with the grey model theory, and the prediction engine is operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbour algorithm. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server for iGPCR-drug was established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iGPCR-Drug/. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to follow the complicated math equations presented in this paper just for its integrity. The overall success rate achieved by iGPCR-drug via the jackknife test was 85.5{\%}, which is remarkably higher than the rate by the existing peer method developed in 2010 although no web server was ever established for it. It is anticipated that iGPCR-Drug may become a useful high throughput tool for both basic research and drug development, and that the approach presented here can also be extended to study other drug - target interaction networks.},

Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to perform physical experiments to determine whether a drug and a protein are interacting with each other.

With the availability of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, however, a sequence-based solution to deal with this problem is necessary. Following other works in this area, we propose a new machine learning system based on several protein descriptors extracted from several protein representations, such as, variants of the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of proteins, the amino-acid sequence, and a matrix representation of a protein. The prediction engine is operated by an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs), with each SVM trained on a specific descriptor and the results of each SVM combined by sum rule.

abstract = {Knowledge of drug–target interaction (DTI) plays an important role in discovering new drug candidates. Unfortunately, there are unavoidable shortcomings; including the time-consuming and expensive nature of the experimental method to predict DTI. Therefore, it motivates us to develop an effective computational method to predict DTI based on protein sequence. In the paper, we proposed a novel computational approach based on protein sequence, namely PDTPS (Predicting Drug Targets with Protein Sequence) to predict DTI. The PDTPS method combines Bi-gram probabilities (BIGP), Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In order to evaluate the prediction capacity of the PDTPS, the experiment was carried out on enzyme, ion channel, GPCR, and nuclear receptor datasets by using five-fold cross-validation tests. The proposed PDTPS method achieved average accuracy of 97.73{\%}, 93.12{\%}, 86.78{\%}, and 87.78{\%} on enzyme, ion channel, GPCR and nuclear receptor datasets, respectively. The experimental results showed that our method has good prediction performance. Furthermore, in order to further evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed PDTPS method, we compared it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier on enzyme and ion channel datasets, and other exiting methods on four datasets. The promising comparison results further demonstrate that the efficiency and robust of the proposed PDTPS method. This makes it a useful tool and suitable for predicting DTI, as well as other bioinformatics tasks.},

Drug repositioning is a potential approach to solve this dilemma. However, experimental identification and validation of potential drug targets encoded by the human genome is both costly and time-consuming. Therefore, effective computational approaches have been proposed to facilitate drug repo-sitioning, which have proved to be successful in drug discovery. Doubtlessly, the availability of open-accessible data from basic chemical biology research and the success of human genome sequencing are crucial to develop effective in silico drug repositioning methods allowing the identification of potential targets for existing drugs. In this work, we review several che-mogenomic data-driven computational algorithms with source codes publicly accessible for predicting drug–target interac-tions (DTIs). We organize these algorithms by model properties and model evolutionary relationships. We re-implemented five representative algorithms in R programming language, and compared these algorithms by means of mean percentile ranking, a new recall-based evaluation metric in the DTI prediction research field.

In a series of binding residue prediction tasks, 3D-structure-based methods are widely superior to sequence-based methods. However, due to the great number of proteins with known amino acid sequences, sequence-based methods have considerable room for improvement with the development of deep learning. Therefore, prediction of protein-ligand binding residues with deep learning requires study. In this study, we propose a new sequence-based approach called DeepCSeqSite for ab initio protein-ligand binding residue prediction. DeepCSeqSite includes a standard edition and an enhanced edition. The classifier of DeepCSeqSite is based on a deep convolutional neural network. Several convolutional layers are stacked on top of each other to extract hierarchical features. The size of the effective context scope is expanded as the number of convolutional layers increases. The long-distance dependencies between residues can be captured by the large effective context scope, and stacking several layers enables the maximum length of dependencies to be precisely controlled. The extracted features are ultimately combined through one-by-one convolution kernels and softmax to predict whether the residues are binding residues. The state-of-the-art ligand-binding method COACH and some of its submethods are selected as baselines. The methods are tested on a set of 151 nonredundant proteins and three extended test sets. Experiments show that the improvement of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is no less than 0.05. In addition, a training data augmentation method that slightly improves the performance is discussed in this study. Without using any templates that include 3D-structure data, DeepCSeqSite significantlyoutperforms existing sequence-based and 3D-structure-based methods, including COACH. Augmentation of the training sets slightly improves the performance. The model, code and datasets are available at

abstract = {All protein-protein interaction (PPI) predictors require the determination of an operational decision threshold when differentiating positive PPIs from negatives. Historically, a single global threshold, typically optimized via cross-validation testing, is applied to all protein pairs. However, we here use data visualization techniques to show that no single decision threshold is suitable for all protein pairs, given the inherent diversity of protein interaction profiles. The recent development of high throughput PPI predictors has enabled the comprehensive scoring of all possible protein-protein pairs. This, in turn, has given rise to context, enabling us now to evaluate a PPI within the context of all possible predictions. Leveraging this context, we introduce a novel modeling framework called Reciprocal Perspective (RP), which estimates a localized threshold on a per-protein basis using several rank order metrics. By considering a putative PPI from the perspective of each of the proteins within the pair, RP rescores the predicted PPI and applies a cascaded Random Forest classifier leading to improvements in recall and precision. We here validate RP using two state-of-the-art PPI predictors, the Protein-protein Interaction Prediction Engine and the Scoring PRotein INTeractions methods, over five organisms: Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Mus musculus. Results demonstrate the application of a post hoc RP rescoring layer significantly improves classification (p {\textless} 0.001) in all cases over all organisms and this new rescoring approach can apply to any PPI prediction method.},

abstract = {The identification of interactions between drugs and target proteins plays a key role in the process of genomic drug discovery. It is both consuming and costly to determine drug-target interactions by experiments alone. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new in silico prediction approaches capable of identifying these potential drug-target interactions in a timely manner. In this article, we aim at extending current structure-activity relationship (SAR) methodology to fulfill such requirements. In some sense, a drug-target interaction can be regarded as an event or property triggered by many influence factors from drugs and target proteins. Thus, each interaction pair can be represented theoretically by using these factors which are based on the structural and physicochemical properties simultaneously from drugs and proteins. To realize this, drug molecules are encoded with MACCS substructure fingerings representing existence of certain functional groups or fragments; and proteins are encoded with some biochemical and physicochemical properties. Four classes of drug-target interaction networks in humans involving enzymes, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors, are independently used for establishing predictive models with support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM models gave prediction accuracy of 90.31{\%}, 88.91{\%}, 84.68{\%} and 83.74{\%} for four datasets, respectively. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the ability of our proposed method to predict the drug-target interactions, and show a general compatibility between the new scheme and current SAR methodology. They open the way to a host of new investigations on the diversity analysis and prediction of drug-target interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With the features of extremely high selectivity and efficiency in catalyzing almost all the chemical reactions in cells, enzymes play vitally important roles for the life of an organism and hence have become frequent targets for drug design. An essential step in developing drugs by targeting enzymes is to identify drug-enzyme interactions in cells. It is both time-consuming and costly to do this purely by means of experimental techniques alone. Although some computational methods were developed in this regard based on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of enzyme, unfortunately their usage is quite limited because three-dimensional structures of many enzymes are still unknown. Here, we reported a sequence-based predictor, called "iEzy-Drug," in which each drug compound was formulated by a molecular fingerprint with 258 feature components, each enzyme by the Chou's pseudo amino acid composition generated via incorporating sequential evolution information and physicochemical features derived from its sequence, and the prediction engine was operated by the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The overall success rate achieved by iEzy-Drug via rigorous cross-validations was about 91{\%}. Moreover, to maximize the convenience for the majority of experimental scientists, a user-friendly web server was established, by which users can easily obtain their desired results.},

An example of one recent approach is ultrafast affinity extraction.

These free fractions have also been used to determine the binding constants and rate constants for the interactions of drugs with these soluble agents. This report describes the general principles of ultrafast affinity extraction and the experimental conditions under which it can be used to characterize such interactions. This method will be illustrated by utilizing data that have been obtained when using this approach to measure the binding and dissociation of various drugs with the serum transport proteins human serum albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. A number of practical factors will be discussed that should be considered in the design and optimization of this approach for use with single-column or multi-column systems. Techniques will also be described for analyzing the resulting data for the determination of free fractions, rate constants and binding constants. In addition, the extension of this method to complex samples, such as clinical specimens, will be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Visualization concerns the representation of data visually and is an important task in scientific research. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are discovered using either wet lab techniques, such mass spectrometry, or in silico predictions tools, resulting in large collections of interactions stored in specialized databases. The set of all interactions of an organism forms a protein-protein interaction network (PIN) and is an important tool for studying the behaviour of the cell machinery. Since graphic representation of PINs may highlight important substructures, e.g. protein complexes, visualization is more and more used to study the underlying graph structure of PINs. Although graphs are well known data structures, there are different open problems regarding PINs visualization: the high number of nodes and connections, the heterogeneity of nodes (proteins) and edges (interactions), the possibility to annotate proteins and interactions with biological information extracted by ontologies (e.g. Gene Ontology) that enriches the PINs with semantic information, but complicates their visualization. METHODS In these last years many software tools for the visualization of PINs have been developed. Initially thought for visualization only, some of them have been successively enriched with new functions for PPI data management and PIN analysis. The paper analyzes the main software tools for PINs visualization considering four main criteria: (i) technology, i.e. availability/license of the software and supported OS (Operating System) platforms; (ii) interoperability, i.e. ability to import/export networks in various formats, ability to export data in a graphic format, extensibility of the system, e.g. through plug-ins; (iii) visualization, i.e. supported layout and rendering algorithms and availability of parallel implementation; (iv) analysis, i.e. availability of network analysis functions, such as clustering or mining of the graph, and the possibility to interact with external databases. RESULTS Currently, many tools are available and it is not easy for the users choosing one of them. Some tools offer sophisticated 2D and 3D network visualization making available many layout algorithms, others tools are more data-oriented and support integration of interaction data coming from different sources and data annotation. Finally, some specialistic tools are dedicated to the analysis of pathways and cellular processes and are oriented toward systems biology studies, where the dynamic aspects of the processes being studied are central. CONCLUSION A current trend is the deployment of open, extensible visualization tools (e.g. Cytoscape), that may be incrementally enriched by the interactomics community with novel and more powerful functions for PIN analysis, through the development of plug-ins. On the other hand, another emerging trend regards the efficient and parallel implementation of the visualization engine that may provide high interactivity and near real-time response time, as in NAViGaTOR. From a technological point of view, open-source, free and extensible tools, like Cytoscape, guarantee a long term sustainability due to the largeness of the developers and users communities, and provide a great flexibility since new functions are continuously added by the developer community through new plug-ins, but the emerging parallel, often closed-source tools like NAViGaTOR, can offer near real-time response time also in the analysis of very huge PINs.},

abstract = {Diclofenac is a potent NSAID of clinical choice, which is widely used for containing inflammation. Moreover , recent experimental evidences overwhelmingly substantiate its antineoplastic potential. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of diclofenac's anticancer activity remain poorly understood. Neoplas-tic cells display reprogrammed metabolic features, which are manifested and regulated by a complex networking of molecular pathways. However, the effect of diclofenac on tumor cell metabolism are not yet clearly deciphered. Hence, the present investigation was carried out to identify and characterize key diclofenac targets of tumor metabolism, cell survival and chemoresistance. The interactions of diclofenac with such targets was analysed by PatchDock and YASARA (Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application). The docking ability of diclofenac with its targets was based on analysis of dissociation constant (Kd), geometric shape complementarity score (GSC score), approximate interface area (AI area) and binding energy. The findings of this investigation reveal that diclofenac is capable of interacting with all of the selected molecular targets. Prominent interactions were observed with GLUT1, MCT4, LDH A, COX1, COX2, BCRP/ABCG2, HDM2/MDM2 and MRP1 compared to other targets. Interactions were of noncova-lent nature involving ionic, hydrophobic interactions, Van der Waals forces and H-bonds, which varied depending on targets. This study for the first time, characterizes the nature of molecular interactions of diclofenac with selected targets involved in cancer cell metabolism, pH homeostasis, chemosensitivity, cell signalling and inflammation. Hence, these findings will be highly beneficial in optimizing the utility of diclofenac in development of novel cancer therapeutics.},

However, an interaction with off-target tissues of a drug might be one of the unintended effect-related mechanisms. We propose two processes to predict a drug's unintended effects by off-target tissue effects: 1) identification of a drug's off-target tissue and; 2) tissue protein - symptom relation identification (tissue protein - symptom matrix). Using this method, we predicted that 1,177 (10.7{\%}) side-effects were related to off-target tissue effects in 11,041 known side-effects. Off-target tissues and unintended effects of successful repositioning drugs were also predicted. The effectiveness of relations of the proposed tissue protein - symptom matrix were evaluated by using the literature mining method. We predicted unintended effects of drugs as well as those effect-related off-target tissues. By using our prediction, we are able to reduce drug side-effects on off-target tissues and provide a chance to identify new indications of drugs of interest.},

abstract = {Information about the interactions of drug compounds with proteins in cellular networking is very important for drug development. Unfortunately, all the existing predictors for identifying drug-protein interactions were trained by a skewed benchmark data-set where the number of non-interactive drug-protein pairs is overwhelmingly larger than that of the interactive ones. Using this kind of highly unbalanced benchmark data-set to train predictors would lead to the outcome that many interactive drug-protein pairs might be mispredicted as non-interactive. Since the minority interactive pairs often contain the most important information for drug design, it is necessary to minimize this kind of misprediction. In this study, we adopted the neighborhood cleaning rule and synthetic minority over-sampling technique to treat the skewed benchmark datasets and balance the positive and negative subsets. The new benchmark datasets thus obtained are called the optimized benchmark datasets, based on which a new predictor called iDrug-Target was developed that contains four sub-predictors: iDrug-GPCR, iDrug-Chl, iDrug-Ezy, and iDrug-NR, specialized for identifying the interactions of drug compounds with GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors), ion channels, enzymes, and NR (nuclear receptors), respectively. Rigorous cross-validations on a set of experiment-confirmed datasets have indicated that these new predictors remarkably outperformed the existing ones for the same purpose. To maximize users convenience, a public accessible Web server for iDrug-Target has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iDrug-Target/, by which users can easily get their desired results. It has not escaped our notice that the aforementioned strategy can be widely used in many other areas as well.},

At the same time, the traditional form of backpropagation is biologically implausible. In the present paper we propose an unusual learning rule, which has a degree of biological plausibility and which is motivated by Hebb's idea that change of the synapse strength should be local—i.e., should depend only on the activities of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We design a learning algorithm that utilizes global inhibition in the hidden layer and is capable of learning early feature detectors in a completely unsupervised way. These learned lower-layer feature detectors can be used to train higher-layer weights in a usual supervised way so that the performance of the full network is comparable to the performance of standard feedforward networks trained end-to-end with a backpropagation algorithm on simple tasks.},

abstract = {A core concept behind modern drug discovery is finding a small molecule that modulates a function of a target protein. This concept has been successfully applied since the mid-1970s. However, the efficiency of drug discovery is decreasing because the druggable target space in the human proteome is limited. Recently, protein–protein interaction (PPI) has been identified as an emerging target space for drug discovery. PPI plays a pivotal role in biological pathways including diseases. Current human interactome research suggests that the number of PPIs is between 130,000 and 650,000, and only a small number of them have been targeted as drug targets. For traditional drug targets, in silico structure-based methods have been successful in many cases. However, their performance suffers on PPI interfaces because PPI interfaces are different in five major aspects: From a geometric standpoint, they have relatively large interface regions, flat geometry, and the interface surface shape tends to fluctuate upon binding. Also, their interactions are dominated by hydrophobic atoms, which is different from traditional binding-pocket-targeted drugs. Finally, PPI targets usually lack natural molecules that bind to the target PPI interface. Here, we first summarize characteristics of PPI interfaces and their known binders. Then, we will review existing in silico structure-based approaches for discovering small molecules that bind to PPI interfaces.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have synthesized a series of N-benzoyl-N′-phenyl thiourea derivatives and characterized them by FTIR, elemental analysis, NMR, and X-ray single crystal diffraction. Intermolecular interactions were shown via N–H⋯O, N–H⋯S, C–H⋯O, C–H⋯S hydrogen bonds and $\pi$⋯$\pi$ interactions in crystal. Furthermore, antifungal activity of these compounds was determined against Fusarium graminearum, Botryosphaeria ribis, Botryosphaeria berengriana and Cercospora brassicicola P. Hennings. In order to screen anti-cancer drugs, molecular docking was performed by using Hsp90 protein and target ligands (1∼8). Finally, parameters drug-likeness, ADME properties, toxicity effects (mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritant, and reproductive) and drug scores were calculated for evaluating bioavailability of thioureas. The results show that compound 4 has good antifungal activity compared with standard drugs and compound 5 has the potential to become an HSP90 inhibitor. More importantly, all synthesized compounds had good drug-likeness properties.},

In this review, we present a brief introduction of the available molecular docking methods, and their development and applications in drug discovery. The relevant basic theories, including sampling algorithms and scoring functions, are summarized. The differences in and performance of available docking software are also discussed. Flexible receptor molecular docking approaches, especially those including backbone flexibility in receptors, are a challenge for available docking methods. A recently developed Local Move Monte Carlo (LMMC) based approach is introduced as a potential solution to flexible receptor docking problems. Three application examples of molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are provided. Introduction},

The prediction method is based on solvent accessible surface area of residues in the isolated subunits, a propensity scale for interface residues and a clustering algorithm to identify surface regions with residues of high interface propensities. Here we illustrate the application of InterProSurf to determine which areas of Bacillus anthracis toxins and measles virus hemagglutinin protein interact with their respective cell surface receptors.

abstract = {Computational methods for predicting drug-target interactions have become important in drug research because they can help to reduce the time, cost, and failure rates for developing new drugs. Recently, with the accumulation of drug-related data sets related to drug side effects and pharmacological data, it has became possible to predict potential drug-target interactions. In this study, we focus on drug-drug interactions (DDI), their adverse effects ([Formula: see text]) and pharmacological information ([Formula: see text]), and investigate the relationship among chemical structures, side effects, and DDIs from several data sources. In this study, [Formula: see text] data from the STITCH database, [Formula: see text] from drugs.com, and drug-target pairs from ChEMBL and SIDER were first collected. Then, by applying two machine learning approaches, a support vector machine (SVM) and a kernel-based L1-norm regularized logistic regression (KL1LR), we showed that DDI is a promising feature in predicting drug-target interactions. Next, the accuracies of predicting drug-target interactions using DDI were compared to those obtained using the chemical structure and side effects based on the SVM and KL1LR approaches, showing that DDI was the data source contributing the most for predicting drug-target interactions.},

@article{Finkelstein2017b,
abstract = {The ability of protein chains to spontaneously form their spatial structures is a long-standing puzzle in molecular biology. Experimentally measured folding times of single-domain globular proteins range from microseconds to hours: the difference (10–11 orders of magnitude) is the same as that between the life span of a mosquito and the age of the universe. This review describes physical theories of rates of overcoming the free-energy barrier separating the natively folded (N) and unfolded (U) states of protein chains in both directions: “U-to-N” and “N-to-U”. In the theory of protein folding rates a special role is played by the point of thermodynamic (and kinetic) equilibrium between the native and unfolded state of the chain; here, the theory obtains the simplest form. Paradoxically, a theoretical estimate of the folding time is easier to get from consideration of protein unfolding (the “N-to-U” transition) rather than folding, because it is easier to outline a good unfolding pathway of any structure than a good folding pathway that leads to the stable fold, which is yet unknown to the folding protein chain. And since the rates of direct and reverse reactions are equal at the equilibrium point (as follows from the physical “detailed balance” principle), the estimated folding time can be derived from the estimated unfolding time. Theoretical analysis of the “N-to-U” transition outlines the range of protein folding rates in a good agreement with experiment. Theoretical analysis of folding (the “U-to-N” transition), performed at the level of formation and assembly of protein secondary structures, outlines the upper limit of protein folding times (i.e., of the time of search for the most stable fold). Both theories come to essentially the same results; this is not a surprise, because they describe overcoming one and the same free-energy barrier, although the way to the top of this barrier from the side of the unfolded state is very different from the way from the side of the native state; and both theories agree with experiment. In addition, they predict the maximal size of protein domains that fold under solely thermodynamic (rather than kinetic) control and explain the observed maximal size of the “foldable” protein domains.},

@article{Wolpert2005,
abstract = { Recent work on the foundational underpinnings of black-box optimization has begun to uncover a rich mathematical structure. In particular, it is now known that an inner product between the optimization algorithm and the distribution of optimization problems likely to be encountered fixes the distribution over likely performances in running that algorithm. One ramification of this is the "No Free Lunch" (NFL) theorems, which state that any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems. This highlights the need for exploiting problem-specific knowledge to achieve better than random performance. In this paper, we present a general framework covering most optimization scenarios. In addition to the optimization scenarios addressed in the NFL results, this framework covers multiarmed bandit problems and evolution of multiple coevolving players. As a particular instance of the latter, it covers "self-play" problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game. In contrast to the traditional optimization case where the NFL results hold, we show that in self-play there are free lunches: in coevolution some algorithms have better performance than other algorithms, averaged across all possible problems. However, in the typical coevolutionary scenarios encountered in biology, where there is no champion, the NFL theorems still hold.},

Computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools can act as a virtual shortcut, assisting in the expedition of this long process and potentially reducing the cost of research and development. Today CADD has become an effective and indispensable tool in therapeutic development. The human genome project has made available a substantial amount of sequence data that can be used in various drug discovery projects. Additionally, increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as increasing computer power have made it possible to use computational methods effectively in various phases of the drug discovery and development pipeline. The importance of in silico tools is greater than ever before and has advanced pharmaceutical research. Here we present an overview of computational methods used in different facets of drug discovery and highlight some of the recent successes. In this review, both structure-based and ligand-based drug discovery methods are discussed. Advances in virtual high-throughput screening, protein structure prediction methods, protein-ligand docking, pharmacophore modeling and QSAR techniques are reviewed.},

abstract = {On October 5, 1981, Fortune magazine published a cover article entitled the "Next Industrial Revolution: Designing Drugs by Computer at Merck". With a 40+ year investment, we have been in the drug design business longer than most. During its history, the Merck drug design group has had several names, but it has always been in the "design" business, with the ultimate goal to provide an actionable hypothesis that could be tested experimentally. Often the result was a small molecule but it could just as easily be a peptide, biologic, predictive model, reaction, process, etc. To this end, the concept of design is now front and center in all aspects of discovery, safety assessment and early clinical development. At present, the Merck design group includes computational chemistry, protein structure determination, and cheminformatics. By bringing these groups together under one umbrella, we were able to align activities and capabilities across multiple research sites and departments. This alignment from 2010 to 2016 resulted in an 80{\%} expansion in the size of the department, reflecting the increase in impact due to a significant emphasis across the organization to "design first" along the entire drug discovery path from lead identification (LID) to first in human (FIH) dosing. One of the major advantages of this alignment has been the ability to access all of the data and create an adaptive approach to the overall LID to FIH pathway for any modality, significantly increasing the quality of candidates and their probability of success. In this perspective, we will discuss how we crafted a new strategy, defined the appropriate phenotype for group members, developed the right skillsets, and identified metrics for success in order to drive continuous improvement. We will not focus on the tactical implementation, only giving specific examples as appropriate.},
