Statistical Analyses to DO:
1. KIBA Score Distribution
2. Amino Acid counts (20 standards) -- For each protein sequence get total counts, sort by length -- (corresponding to one-hot)
3. Drug Sequence Counts similar to amino acid (Logarithmic-corresponding to one-hots)
4. 
Things to do:
1. System Block remake (remove calculation of KIBA Scores)

Figure ~\ref{fig:system} shows the different stages our research goes for building a protein drug prediction system. The data is collected by exploring the available internet sources and required dataset is downloaded for processing. From the data, the missing values are removed in data preprocessing to aid proper training. From the raw drugs and proteins profile, SMILES and FASTA sequences are extracted respectively. Now the features are extraced based on the sequence provided. Then, the features are fed into Deep Learning Algorithm where the training is done to create the right prediction system. Again


\subsection{Data Collection}

The dataset is collected from open-internet database. There are basically three types of data required in this work: protein, drug and interaction sets. The UniProt Library has been used for extracting proteins features, PubChem for drug features, and NCBI for interaction scores. Additionally, PSI-BLAST is used to generate PSSM matrices for the protein features downloaded.

UniProt contains database of 173,281 proteins of human (Homo sapiens) (until 2019). The protein document consists of the taxonomic classification, identifiers to other databases for cross-linking,  molecular properties, related specific bioactivity, functional property, canonical and isoforms of protein sequence. The protein fasta sequence in particular is of interest to the work produced. An api can be used to download the available information.

PubCHEM and CHEMBL are drug databases used for feature extraction of drug molecules. PubCHEM is a database containing 96,881,514 drug compounds and associates to each using CID identifier. It allows programmatic access and downloads of database text files. The SMILES structure provided by the PubChem library is used to generate features corresponding to each drug molecule. The properties associated with the molecule is explored using CHEMBL database using a programmatic api request provided.

UniCHEM is a very useful repository that has been integrated with various web-services. The queries can be done from GET request and JSON text can be retrieved in response to the request. The database can be used to retrieve structure information, mappings, InChIKey and source information related to drug molecule. The InChIKey is used in this work to construct features for small drug molecule (aka ligand).

For the drug-target interaction (i.e. drug-protein interaction), we use KIBA scores \cite{Tang2013} instead of binary classification. Thus, we try to solve the problem into a regression problem to predict the drug and protein interaction. The KIBA score regression has two major advantages over binary classification: interaction strength of similarly interacting ligands-target (drugs-protein) can be compared and the bias problem of unknown interactions is refrained \cite{Tang2013,ozturk2018deepdta}. Higher score means that there is more strength of interaction between the two. We use \arabic{no_drugs} ligands as drugs and \arabic{no_proteins} human proteins as target for the prediction problem.

various components used to form the prediction system. The idea is basic in that protein interaction depends on the structural and chemical properties. The primary canonical structure of protein-drug set are fed into interaction block. The interaction parameter is filtered accordingly to the filter type. Similarly, the drug feature set are created to be trained with the machine learning algorithm. Finally, after training the training dataset, we cross validate the model with test dataset.
