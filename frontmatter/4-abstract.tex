Protein and Drug interactions are the long debated terms in the field of computational bioinformatics. Finding them based on molecular fingerprints and protein sequences alone is itself challenging as the process involving the true interaction depends on pathways, molecular properties, chaperones and more. Moreover the structural properties in the case of protein has different dimensions among which the efficient representation exists in the form of primary and secondary information. In this work the representation of drugs in fingerprints and proteins in sequence are used to generate features. The major components of feature vectors used in this work that bring the better prediction are PSSM-DT, Embedding and RPT vectors. These features are transformed to create suitable feature sets for training a deep learning algorithm using state of art technique. We use KIBA score to quantify the interaction to discriminate the similarly interacting proteins and drugs.
