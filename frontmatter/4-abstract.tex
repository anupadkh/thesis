Protein and Drugs are the major analysis subjects in computational bioinformatics to produce conclusions in treatment of diseases. While scientific methods are progressing with experiments and medical principles, they are still expensive means to discover the cure of new diseases. In principle, the high computing systems can be used to reduce the costs related to discovery. With the evolving nature of disease for instance, due to mutation, there has been extensive research work on exploring the fundamental properties of proteins and drugs to find the correct match in treatment. Finding the interaction between drugs and proteins based on their molecular fingerprints and protein sequences has been explored using statistical methods and rule-based methods. The representation of drugs in fingerprints and proteins in sequence are used to map them to different domains, which are then trained in a deep neural net to produce a regression solution. Instead of relying on binary classification, the more superior KIBA scores are used to quantify the interaction score between the drugs and proteins. The feature vectors, PSSMDT, Embedding and RPT, are combined to aid the deep learning state-of-art solution with convolution and dense layers, and aid to prediction score of 89%.
